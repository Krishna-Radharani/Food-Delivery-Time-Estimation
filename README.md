## 🧠 Model Architecture

### Step 1: Predict Pickup Time  
A **Linear Regression** model is trained to predict the time a restaurant takes to hand over the food after an order.

### Step 2: Predict Final ETA  
That predicted pickup time is then used as input to a **blended model** (XGBoost + LGBM) to predict final delivery time.
